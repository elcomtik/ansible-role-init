Example Playbook
----------------

This role is specific, because we sugest that host is not yet capable of Ansible managment(missing python, libs, priviledged accounts, ...). So we use very limited ansible features, to cope with this environment and hopefully setup this features with this role. :

	- hosts: all
	  remote_user: root
	  become: no
	  gather_facts: False
	
	  pre_tasks:
	  - name: Override variables
	    set_fact:
	      ansible_user: 'root' 
	
	  roles:
	    - ansible-role-init
